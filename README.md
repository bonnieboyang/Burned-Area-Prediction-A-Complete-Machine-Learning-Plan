# Burned-Area-Prediction-A-Complete-Machine-Learning-Plan
Wild fires destroy millions of hectares of forest every year. Forest files are costly and dangerous. Fast detection and response is the key to mitigating their destruction. In this project we use weather and meteorological data from the northeast region of Portugal to predict the burned area (or size) of forest fires.
